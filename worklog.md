Task: Port the music-nexus repo (https://github.com/musixkube-cmyk/music-nexus.git) from a TanStack Start SPA to a full Next.js 16 App Router app, then wait for further instructions.

Work Log:
- Cloned source to /tmp/music-nexus-src. Identified it as a TanStack Start + TanStack Router SSR app ("Musicosy" marketing site): root shell (__root.tsx) with SiteHeader + Outlet + SiteFooter, home route (index.tsx) with disco-video hero + ticker + "Trending this week" + "Newly dropped" + "Pick your lane" grids, and a splat catch-all ($.tsx) that looks up any nav-tree node by path (findNode/findTrail) and renders a breadcrumb + children grid, 404-ing on unknown paths. No backend/auth/DB — pure content site. Brand design system: stonish-gray bg, orange accent, near-black "ink", Bebas Neue display + Barlow body fonts, marquee-track + disco-sheen CSS utilities.
- Copied source assets into target public/: hero-disco.jpg, favicon.ico, robots.txt.
- Rewrote src/app/globals.css with the source's brand oklch tokens (added --ink, --ink-foreground, --stone-deep, orange --accent, --font-display/--font-sans mappings) and ported the marquee-track + disco-sheen @utility blocks + keyframes. Kept Tailwind v4 structure (@import "tailwindcss", @theme inline, :root/.dark).
- Rewrote src/app/layout.tsx: Bebas_Neue + Barlow via next/font/google (mapped to --font-display/--font-sans), Musicosy metadata (title/description/OG/twitter), viewport export, and a min-h-screen flex flex-col shell rendering SiteHeader + flex-1 children + SiteFooter. Kept Toaster.
- Ported src/data/nav.ts and src/data/releases.ts verbatim (megaMenu, footerNav, findNode, findTrail, trending, newlyDropped).
- Rewrote src/components/site/nav-link.tsx as a client component over next/link + usePathname, re-implementing TanStack's built-in activeProps (next/link has none) with descendant-aware active matching.
- Ported src/components/site/site-header.tsx (client, useState mobile menu, hover mega-panels) and src/components/site/site-footer.tsx (server). Fixed a react-hooks/static-components lint error by rendering the dynamic lucide icon via createElement instead of a capitalized local (<Icon/>).
- Rewrote src/app/page.tsx as a Server Component (home). Hero <video> kept for structure but the unreachable Lovable-internal MP4 src was dropped; poster="/hero-disco.jpg" renders the disco image + gradient overlay faithfully. Added page-level metadata.
- Created src/app/[...path]/page.tsx as an async Server Component (Next 16 params is a Promise): resolvePath, generateMetadata (title/description/OG + robots noindex for unknown), notFound() when findNode misses, breadcrumb via findTrail, children grid.
- Created src/app/not-found.tsx (404) and src/app/error.tsx (client error boundary with reset + go-home), faithful to the source's NotFoundComponent/ErrorComponent.
- Lint clean (bun run lint). Dev server runs on :3000 (was already running; HMR picked up changes).

Verification (Agent Browser):
- Home renders: title "Musicosy — Stream, Sell, Settle. One Platform.", h1 "The floor is open", 4 sections, 12 track cards + 4 lane cards, header+footer present. Computed styles confirm brand tokens applied (stone-gray bg, orange accent, near-black ink, Bebas Neue h1, Barlow body). No console/page errors.
- Client-side nav: clicked "For Creators" → /for-creators, title "For Creators — Musicosy" (generateMetadata works), h1 + blurb + 14 child cards + breadcrumb "HOME / FOR CREATORS".
- Deep routes: /for-labels/by-role/for-managers (200), /for-fans/follow-artists (200) — catch-all handles full nav-tree depth.
- 404: /no-such-page → 404 status, title "Page not found — Musicosy", h1 "404", h2 "Page not found", "Go home" link, robots noindex.
- Sticky footer: layout uses min-h-screen flex flex-col + flex-1 content wrapper; footer pushed down naturally on long pages, present on short leaf pages (/discover). No floating gap.
- Mobile menu (390x844): hamburger toggles open, shows full nav tree; clicking "Follow artists" navigates to /for-fans/follow-artists AND auto-closes the menu (onClick setOpen(false)).
- Mega-menu hover: headless Chromium reports hover:none, so Tailwind v4's @media (hover: hover) gate (identical to the source's compiled CSS) prevents group-hover:* rules from firing. Proved the wiring is correct by injecting a non-gated equivalent: on hover the panel revealed with visibility:visible, opacity:1, intro h3 "For Fans", promo h4, 10 links. Works on real hover-capable desktop browsers exactly as in the source.

Stage Summary:
- Faithful port complete: TanStack Start file-routes → Next.js 16 App Router (layout.tsx, page.tsx, [...path]/page.tsx, not-found.tsx, error.tsx). All design tokens, fonts, utilities, components, and routes preserved. No backend/auth/DB introduced (source had none). Lint clean, dev server clean, all golden-path interactions browser-verified.
- One intentional deviation: the hero video's src (a Lovable-internal URL that only resolves inside Lovable's preview) was dropped; the <video> element + poster image are kept so the disco hero renders correctly. A commented note in page.tsx explains how to restore motion by dropping a real /hero-disco.mp4 into public/.
- Now waiting for the user's further instructions per their request.
